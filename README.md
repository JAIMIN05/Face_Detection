# Real-Time Face Detection System

## Description:

The Real-Time Face Detection System is a computer vision project developed using Python and OpenCV. The system detects human faces in real-time using a webcam feed and highlights them with bounding boxes.
It leverages the Haar Cascade classifier, a machine learning-based approach trained for frontal face detection, 
ensuring accurate performance under various conditions. This project provides a simple graphical user interface, dynamically scalable to handle varying face sizes and distances. 
With its real-time detection capability, the system can be applied in security systems, surveillance, human-computer interaction, and more.

This project is prepared by jaimin(22CS028) and Samarth(22CS020).
